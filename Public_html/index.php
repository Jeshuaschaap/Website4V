            Hello, and welcome to my website! I'm glad that you decided to come and take a visit!
            As you have probably noticed already, I will be writing this website in English. 
            <br> Just because that way a lot of people find it easier to read, and I also enjoy it a lot more! 
            <br> Just for your information, this website is created by me using my own knowledge and using the internet!
        </p>
