<br>
<p>My name is Jeshua Timothy Schaap</p>
<br>
<p>I'm 15 years old and I live in Alphen aan den Rijn.
I have a brother, his name is Thobian and he is 17 years old, I have got a dog and a couple of cats.
I also like to play volleybal and play computer games, but I will come back to this later on. 
My parents are divorced so I switch houses a lot, but I'm used to it by now. In this project I will be telling some
stuff about myself and about my friends. I hope you enjoy! And dont forget to ask if you have any questions regarding
me or my website!</p>

First of all...</div>
<div class="blackline"></div>
This is my brother, Thobian Jeremy Schaap. As i said, he is 17 years old and also graduated on Groene Hart Lyceum. 
Later this year he will be attending the TIO in Rotterdam, he will be studying Hotel and Event managing. I started with
my brother because he is the person I have know for the longest period of time, obviously.

we also had to descripe how we experienced everything. Initially I wanted to use our classphoto for my website, but unfortunately I
lost that photo. So here we are!</div></div></div></div>

Things I do in my free time...</div>
<div class="blackline"></div>
I like to do a lot of different things in my freetime, things like volleybal, gaming, making music and more...
Volleybal for me is nothing but stress-relief. When I play volleybal I can empty my head and can just be myself, and 
thats what I like about the sport. I also like programming and gaming a lot, because this is just relaxing and it calms me.

Making music with friends!</div>
<div class="whitelinetwo"></div>
I started playing guitar when I was really young, but I quit when I was 12, after that I only played when I felt 
like it. But recently I started making music with a couple of friends in school and outside of school. Music is just like
gaming and volleybal for me, it's stress-relief and it makes me happy. Both of my parents are artist and make music quite
a lot, and my brother loves to make music too. So you can say I have a very musically oriented family. Fun-fact: the guitar
you see on the left is my actual electric guitar, I also have 2 different ones.
